EES85QPW or EES86QPW|Poetry Workshop|Single term.|This course incorporates the study of poetry with the writing of poetry. We’ll begin with some contemporary writers, explore rhythm, rhyme, and the complex forms, take two weeks to experiment with risks and new approaches, jump back in time to study several of America’s most celebrated voices, and close with a unit on spoken word. Along the way we’ll study poets ranging from Walt Whitman to Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Emily Dickinson to Jason Koo.

As a result of this exposure to intellectually stimulating psychological ideas, students will begin to see how various theories of human behavior can be used to read literature. In addition, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the ways some of the more influential psychologists have made use of literary conventions and techniques in developing and presenting their groundbreaking psychological theories. Throughout the course, students explore and learn to appreciate the many intersections between literature and psychology with the aim of furthering their understanding of the complex interplays between cultural, social and biological factors that contribute to shaping human personalities, behaviors and plot lines as represented in Western literature. Students will offer psychological readings of such major novels as Nabokov’s

It is worthwhile noting that  these two genres often overlap.  Since the bulk of the course will be  devoted to science fiction, the emphasis will be to examine the promise,  the limits, and the ethics of science.
EES87QSL or EES88QSL|Shakespearean Literature|One-term course.|We will explore the many  aspects of human nature and behavior in Shakespeare's tragedies,  comedies and histories. Students should have an appreciation for the  beauty of Shakespeare's language and be eager to read, study, write, and  perform his poetry, prose, soliloquies, sonnets, and scenes.

We will focus both on the subjects these women bring up and the ways in which they write, expressing their voices in forms often different from those used by their male counterparts.
EES87QWW or EES88QWW|Writers Workshop|Single term.|This course is designed to make students aware of the wide-variety of  techniques used by fiction writers and to guide students in practicing  those techniques in their own fiction.

Every choice you make, from the largest creative decisions to the smallest practical solutions, has a profound impact on what appears on the screen and how it moves an audience emotionally. - Mick Hurbis-Cherrier
