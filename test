Poetry Workshop EES85QPW or EES86QPW
Single term.
This course incorporates the study of poetry with the writing of poetry. We’ll begin with some contemporary writers, explore rhythm, rhyme, and the complex forms, take two weeks to experiment with risks and new approaches, jump back in time to study several of America’s most celebrated voices, and close with a unit on spoken word. Along the way we’ll study poets ranging from Walt Whitman to Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Emily Dickinson to Jason Koo. Perhaps most importantly, we’ll be focusing on your writing and the writing of your classmates past and present. As my former student Disi Chen once wrote, “This is not only a class where you write to express but also listen to learn. You’ll be surprised when you hear the poetry of others and realize that everyone has so much to say in so many different styles, you included."

Psychology & Literature EES87X7 & EES88X8
Full-year course. By application.
In this course, students read literary texts from various epochs through the lens of cognitive and behavioral theories. The course focuses on such foundational work in the field of psychology as Sigmund Freud’s theories of the unconscious based on his writings on dream analysis, Carl Jung’s concept on the collective unconscious, and Jacques Lacan’s insistence on the centrality of language in the construction of a sense of self. As a result of this exposure to intellectually stimulating psychological ideas, students will begin to see how various theories of human behavior can be used to read literature. In addition, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the ways some of the more influential psychologists have made use of literary conventions and techniques in developing and presenting their groundbreaking psychological theories. Throughout the course, students explore and learn to appreciate the many intersections between literature and psychology with the aim of furthering their understanding of the complex interplays between cultural, social and biological factors that contribute to shaping human personalities, behaviors and plot lines as represented in Western literature.  Students will offer psychological readings of such major novels as Nabokov’s



Society & Self EES87X5 & EES88X6
Full-year course. By application.
: Society and Self is a year-long course focusing on the ways that individuals define  themselves in the context of wider social forces - religious, economic, political, material and  technological. Rather than taking a strict chronological approach to the literature, we'll follow  the development of ideas about the self (and even the origins of the concept of a literary "self")  by juxtaposing texts from different eras and focusing on the ways that these texts inform and  reflect our own ideas of ourselves and our places in the world. We'll read works by South Asian,  American, and South African writers, as well canonical examples of British literature. Society and Self is  considered an Advanced Placement course, and students are encouraged to take the Advanced  Placement Literature and Composition exam in the spring.

Existentialism EES87QEE or EES88QEE
Single term.
Existentialism is a 20th century philosophy that stresses fervent individualism in the face of an irrational universe.

Single term.
This course incorporates the study of poetry with the writing of poetry. We’ll begin with some contemporary writers, explore rhythm, rhyme, and the complex forms, take two weeks to experiment with risks and new approaches, jump back in time to study several of America’s most celebrated voices, and close with a unit on spoken word. Along the way we’ll study poets ranging from Walt Whitman to Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Emily Dickinson to Jason Koo. Perhaps most importantly, we’ll be focusing on your writing and the writing of your classmates past and present. As my former student Disi Chen once wrote, “This is not only a class where you write to express but also listen to learn. You’ll be surprised when you hear the poetry of others and realize that everyone has so much to say in so many different styles, you included."



Science Fiction & Fantasy EES87QSF or EES88QSF
Single term.

Since the bulk of the course will be  devoted to science fiction, the emphasis will be to examine the promise,  the limits, and the ethics of science.



Shakespearean Literature EES87QSL or EES88QSL
One-term course.

Single term.
This course is open to seniors who wish to examine issues of power, education, sexuality, body image, relationships, representation, and gender roles - to name a few topics - from a pro-female perspective.  Through our reading of novels, short stories, poems, and articles, we will investigate our own assumptions and prejudices, and examine the ways in which these issues have been treated by a number of women authors during the 20th century.  We will focus both on the subjects these women bring up and the ways in which they write, expressing their voices in forms often different from those used by their male counterparts.



Writers Workshop EES87QWW or EES88QWW
Single term.
This course is designed to make students aware of the wide-variety of  techniques used by fiction writers and to guide students in practicing  those techniques in their own fiction. Students will build an awareness  of fiction writing conventions while developing their own unique style.

Considering the minute Jewish global demographic, why have there been so many Jewish geniuses from Einstein to Kafka to Freud?

Where does one begin a journey into the world of filmmaking? Film is creative and it is technical. It is a form of personal expression and a universal language. It requires careful logistical planning and inspired spontaneity. It is the product of a single vision and collaborative energy. Film is also the quintessential hybrid art form, finding its expressive power through the unique amalgam of writing, performance, design, photography, music and editing. And all of it matters. Every choice you make, from the largest creative decisions to the smallest practical solutions, has a profound impact on what appears on the screen and how it moves an audience emotionally. - Mick Hurbis-Cherrier
