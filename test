Digital Video AKS11QFV
Open to Juniors and Seniors.
Where does one begin a journey into the world of filmmaking? Film is creative and it is technical. It is a form of personal expression and a universal language. It requires careful logistical planning and inspired spontaneity. It is the product of a single vision and collaborative energy. Film is also the quintessential hybrid art form, finding its expressive power through the unique amalgam of writing, performance, design, photography, music and editing. And all of it matters. Every choice you make, from the largest creative decisions to the smallest practical solutions, has a profound impact on what appears on the screen and how it moves an audience emotionally. - Mick Hurbis-Cherrier

Through our reading of novels, short stories, poems, and articles, we will investigate our own assumptions and prejudices, and examine the ways in which these issues have been treated by a number of women authors during the 20th century.  We will focus both on the subjects these women bring up and the ways in which they write, expressing their voices in forms often different from those used by their male counterparts.



Writers Workshop EES87QWW or EES88QWW

Where does one begin a journey into the world of filmmaking? Film is creative and it is technical. It is a form of personal expression and a universal language. It requires careful logistical planning and inspired spontaneity. It is the product of a single vision and collaborative energy. Film is also the quintessential hybrid art form, finding its expressive power through the unique amalgam of writing, performance, design, photography, music and editing. And all of it matters. Every choice you make, from the largest creative decisions to the smallest practical solutions, has a profound impact on what appears on the screen and how it moves an audience emotionally. - Mick Hurbis-Cherrier
